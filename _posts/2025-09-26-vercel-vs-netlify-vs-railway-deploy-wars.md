Hey everyone!

You have a project ready, but now comes the question every developer faces: **where to deploy?** Vercel, Netlify, or Railway? The choice isn't obvious and can directly impact your project's success.

Today I'll show you a practical and honest comparison of these three platforms, without bias, so you can make the best decision.

## **First: What's YOUR Project?**

Before comparing platforms, let's identify what you need:

### **Frontend Only (SPA/Static)**
- React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
- Static sites (HTML, CSS, JS)
- JAMstack applications

### **Full-Stack (Frontend + Backend)**
- Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit
- Node.js APIs
- Python/Go/Rust backends

### **Database + Backend**
- Applications with persistent data
- Real-time features
- Complex business logic

## **The Three Titans**

### **üöÄ Vercel**

- **Analytics**: Built-in performance monitoring

**Weaknesses:**
- **Limited backend**: Functions have execution time limits
- **Database**: No built-in database solution
- **Cost**: Can get expensive with high traffic
- **Vendor lock-in**: Very tied to their ecosystem

**Pricing:**
