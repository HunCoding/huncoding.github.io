Hey everyone!

Today I'm going to show you how to create a **multilingual blog** using Jekyll and JavaScript. This is a super useful feature for reaching a **global audience** with your content.

If you want to see the complete process in action, check out the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/example) I recorded about this!

## Why is this useful?

Imagine you have a blog and want to reach both Portuguese and English speakers. Instead of creating separate files for each language, you can:

1. Add translations to your post front matter
2. The system detects the language preference
3. Shows the appropriate content
4. Users can switch languages seamlessly

## How it works

The translation system works by:

- **Front Matter**: Store translations in the post's YAML front matter
- **JavaScript**: Handle language switching on the frontend
- **Plugin**: Process translations during Jekyll build
- **Local Storage**: Remember user's language preference

## Benefits

- ✅ No need for multiple files
- ✅ Easy to maintain
- ✅ SEO friendly
- ✅ User preference persistence
- ✅ Smooth language switching

Try clicking the language toggle button in the top bar to see it in action!
